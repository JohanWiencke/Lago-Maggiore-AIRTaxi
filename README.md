# Lago-Maggiore-AIRTaxi
Lago Maggiore AIRTaxi Series XPLANE 12/11

Installation:

Download the Airport/Airfield that you want. Then unzip it and read the README.txt now you can take the Airport and put it in your Xplane12/Custom Scenery folder.
Startup the game and it should be appearing.
I highly recommend to use Ortho photos for my scenery's because i have used them during the development and some Airports like the Laveno Airfield have small bugs when using 
without Orthohphotos.

Copyrigt:

DO NOT SHARE THESE FILES OR SELL THEM ANYWHERE!!
you can contact me on the Xplane forums if you have questions etc.

Anyways i hope you enjoy my work and i will try to keep updating and realesing new scenery!
